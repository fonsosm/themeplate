== Description ==

A started WordPress Block Theme for building custom themes.

The main purpose of this project is to have a WordPress block theme as a starting point to create a custom theme.

Themeplate has been created along some basic lines:

üé® A minimal color palette.

üìê A scale of font sizes and spacing.

üß± The WordPress blocks have their default styles.

üóÇÔ∏è A minimum hierarchy of files has been created for the templates.

üòé Creation of two CSS style files: one for the main styles of the WordPress theme. The other, to add styles once the theme is deployed and the client wants to make their own customizations.

ü•∏ Creation of a scripts.js file, in case there is a need to add Javascript code.
